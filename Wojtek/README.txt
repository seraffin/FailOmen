OPTIMIZER.ipynb - file with "Optimizer" function written, open for modifications (can work on any numerical data).

NNOptimizer.ipynb - main file: contains optimizer and function calculating neural network. Included modules to check 
                    memory usage on Colab, clear session memory, some tests of accuracy and recall (wrongly implemented at the moment).
