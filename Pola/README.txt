In this directory a user can find an implementation differnt ML approach to problem of chosing test scpoe according to changes in main repo;
1. Workspace_2_workingNN.ipynb - neural network approch - as far as I know the best results, evaluation -30%
2. Workspace_SVM.ipynb - software vector machine approach  -  not so use  full in this case due to all classes required create labels for training process. Alot of labels have got  a small number of memmbers, that couse  unsatisfied results ~15%
3. Workspace_randomForest.ipynb - Random Forest approcha - return width range of results 15-30%, very long training time
